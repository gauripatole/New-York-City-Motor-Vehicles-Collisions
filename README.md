## Conclusion
The top 5 specified causes were Driver errors with "Driver Inattention" leading to 16% of collisions.
11236 was the Zip Code with most collisions (7,311) & deaths (16) while 11233 had the highest death.
rate - 4 deaths for every 1000 collisions that occurred.
Most accidents occurred at 4PM & 5PM ("rush hour") accounting for 15% of the total collisions.
Friday had the most collisions (29,537).
Pedestrians were the most vulnerable of road users having 61% of all deaths, followed by motorists.

## Recommendations
Focus on high collision-prone areas such as 11236, 11229 and 11239 in terms of prioritizing new projects like traffic lights or street signs.
Increased road-usage sensitization for pedestrians especially and other road users.
Increased frequency of driver re-training as against status quo and more stringent fines for repeat offenders.
Deploy more traffic wardens on days with higher collision rate.s
